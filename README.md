Ansible Playbook for [Framework laptop](https://frame.work/) basic setup

This is a project inspired by [mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook).
I want to be able to setup my Framework laptop for my Ubuntu working environment with code.
Since probably all the Framework notebook owner's going to face similar issues while installing the required packages for Linux environment, so I think it makes sense to open source it.

## My hardware & environment (tested)

For now I only run this ansible playbook against my own notebook. It may not work for your distro. Here's my environment:

- **Distro**: Ubuntu Budgie 21.10
- **Wifi**: Intel® Wi-Fi 6E AX210 No vPro®
